## Overview

This project uses three environments below:

- **Development**: local machine
- **Preview**: Vercel preview env (related ADR: [ADR-0001](https://github.com/Rindrics/mikazuki-munechika/blob/main/adr/0001-use-nextjs.md))
- [**Production**](https://stock-assessment.learn-to.live)

## Setup your Development environment

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) 24 or later
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for Supabase local server)

### Setup

#### Install dependencies

```sh
# create local envfile
cp .env.local.template .env.local

# install dependencies
pnpm install

# start Supabase local server
pnpm run start-db
```

Configure `.env.local` with variables shown by the command below:
```sh
# see Supabase variables
pnpm run status-db
```

#### Run database migrations

To apply migrations, run command below:
```sh
pnpm run migrate:local
```

> `pnpm run migrate`is for **production** deployments only. It pushes migrations to the remote Supabase project. For local development, always use `reset-db` or `migrate:local`.
